**Merger Controls in IO Economics & Antitrust: Comprehensive Paper Review**

Merger control is central to IO/antitrust, focusing on price/welfare effects, market definition (SSNIP/HHI), efficiencies, and remedies. Research uses theory (GUPPI/UPPI), empirics (BLP simulation, RDD/DID), and policy analysis. Post-2010 trends: common ownership, vertical/platform mergers, skepticism on efficiencies.
