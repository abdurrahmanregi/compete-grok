Error in synthesis: Found AIMessages with tool_calls that do not have a corresponding ToolMessage. Here are the first few of those tool calls: [{'name': 'route_to_econpaper', 'args': {'reason': 'Deep research on merger controls papers in IO economics and antitrust, focusing on top econ journals (general and field) and preprints like NBER/CEPR. Need to find, summarize, and analyze key papers from these sources.'}, 'id': 'call_65993145', 'type': 'tool_call'}].

Every tool call (LLM requesting to call a tool) in the message history MUST have a corresponding ToolMessage (result of a tool invocation to return to the LLM) - this is required by most LLM providers.
