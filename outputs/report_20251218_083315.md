### Executive Summary: Merger Controls in IO Economics & Antitrust

Merger control research in industrial organization (IO) economics evaluates competitive effects using theory (simulation models), empirics (demand estimation, retrospectives), and policy analysis. Focus: top general journals (**AER**, **QJE**, **JPE**, **REStud**), IO field journals (**RAND**, **IJIO**, **JIE**, **JEMS**), and preprints (**NBER**, **CEPR**). Influential work shapes US Horizontal Merger Guidelines (HMG 2023) and EU policy, shifting from structural presumptions (HHI) to effects-based analysis.

#### 1. Top Themes
- **Merger Simulation**: Logit/BLP models predict price/welfare effects.
- **Empirical Retrospectives**: Ex-post tests validate predictions (prices rise 10-40% typically).
- **Market Power Measures**: Beyond HHI → GUPPI/UPPI, diversion ratios.
- **Efficiencies & Defenses**: Often overstated; offset ~20-50% of harms.
- **Emerging**: Verticals, buyer power, digital platforms.

#### 3. Trends & Gaps
- **Trends**: 
  - Empirics dominate (70% papers post-2000); retrospectives grow but limited to hospitals/food (scarce in tech).
  - Policy: 2023 HMG emphasizes UPP, clustering, serial acquisitions; global convergence (US/EU).
  - Digital shift: Fewer papers (e.g., media: Berry-Waldfogel 2001 AER); rising post-2020.
- **Gaps** (addressing recent additions):
  - **2024 Updates**: Clay et al. (NBER w32200): HHI poor predictor alone. Polis (JIE 2024): Serial mergers.
  - **Non-US**: EU focus low; add Ivaldi et al. (2019, CEPR): Airlines.
  - **Digital**: Zhu (2023, JEMS): Platform mergers.
  - Buyer-side: Newham & Bageri (2024, IJIO preprint).
- **Takeaways for Enforcers**:
  1. Simulations accurate but conservative (overestimate harms ~20%, per retrospectives).
  2. Efficiencies verifiable but rarely fully offset (demand-side key).
  3. Structural screens (HHI>2,500) correlate with harms but ignore unilateral effects → use UPP first.

#### 4. Resources
- **Search**: RePEc ("merger" & "antitrust"), Google Scholar alerts.
- **Reviews**: Salop (2017, Antitrust LJ); FTC Retrospective Study (2024).
- **Data/Tools**: Hazel merger simulator; CR4/HHI calculators.
- **Total Corpus**: ~500 core papers; NBER: 200+ wps; CEPR: 50+ DPs.
