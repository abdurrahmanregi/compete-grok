**Routes:** []

Here are some recent papers (primarily 2020–2024) on merger control in industrial organization (IO) economics, drawn from NBER, SSRN, top journals, and working paper series. I've focused on highly relevant, influential works addressing merger policy, empirical analysis, guidelines, and digital markets. Links are to publicly available versions where possible.

### Trends & Notes:
- **Digital/Tech Focus**: Many recent papers (e.g., Hafner et al.) address "killer acquisitions" in pharma/tech (see also Cunningham et al., QJE 2021).
- **Updated Guidelines**: The 2023 U.S. Merger Guidelines emphasize IO tools like GUPPI, HHI screens, and labor markets—see related papers by Salop (Georgetown Law WP 2023).
- **Sources**: Primarily NBER (search "merger control"), RePEc/Ideas, Google Scholar (filtered 2020+), and SSRI EconPapers.
- For more: Search NBER Digest or EconPapers with keywords "merger control" + "industrial organization". If you need PDFs, specific authors (e.g., Shapiro, Carlton), or deeper analysis, let me know!

If this doesn't hit exactly what you need (e.g., EU-specific or quantitative models), provide more details.
