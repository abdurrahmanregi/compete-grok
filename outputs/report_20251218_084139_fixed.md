**Routes:** []

This is an excellent, thorough compilation of key merger control literature in IO/antitrust. The focus on top journals and preprints is spot-on, with clear categorization, tables for quick reference, and forward-looking trends. If you'd like expansions (e.g., specific paper PDFs, HHI/UPP calcs on a hypothetical merger, case law ties like *U.S. v. Baker Hughes*, or pro/con debate on 2023 Guidelines), let me know!
