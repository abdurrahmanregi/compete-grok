**Final Synthesis on Merger Controls Research**

Integrating the EconPaper outputs: Merger control literature has evolved from theoretical paradoxes (e.g., Salant 1983 QJE) to advanced empirics (Nevo 2000 RAND) and policy tools like UPP (Salop 2009). Key finding: Mergers often harm competition, but efficiencies can mitigate (Farrell-Shapiro 1990 AER). Recent NBER/CEPR emphasize digital/labor effects (e.g., Azar 2018, Benmelech 2024).

This is a self-contained deep dive—ready for use! If debating revisions or extensions, let me know.
