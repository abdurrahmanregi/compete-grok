Excellent research summary! This covers the key papers and trends comprehensively. If you'd like me to:
- Dive into a specific paper (e.g., full summary of Ashenfelter retrospectives),
- Run quantitative examples (e.g., UPP calc for a hypothetical merger),
- Link to case law (e.g., Whole Foods, Staples),
- Or debate pro/con (e.g., "Are merger guidelines too lax?"),

just specify. Otherwise, consider this wrapped. 📚
