**Merger Controls in IO Economics & Antitrust: Deep Research Report**

This report synthesizes top research from general econ journals (AER, QJE, JPE, Econometrica, REStud), IO field journals (RAND, IJIO, JIE, AEJ Micro, RIO), and preprints (NBER IO, CEPR IO). Focus: Seminal theory, empirics, policy. Data from 1980–2024; prioritized >500 cites or recent influence.

### Core Themes
1. **Theory**: Unilateral effects, collusion risk, efficiencies.
2. **Empirics**: Price/welfare post-merger (prices often ↑5–40%).
3. **Policy**: HHI critiques; UPP/GUPPI; 2023 HMG updates.
