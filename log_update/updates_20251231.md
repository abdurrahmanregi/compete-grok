# CompeteGrok Updates Catalog - December 31, 2025

### Summary of Work

1.  **Phase 1: Robustness & Validation (Completed)**
    *   **Strict Mode:** Implemented `STRICT_MODE` in `config.py` to prevent tools from silently falling back to mock data. This ensures that only real, verified data is used.
    *   **Output Validation:** Added Pydantic schemas (`agents/schemas.py`) and updated `graph.py` to strictly validate agent outputs (JSON structure) before proceeding.
    *   **Reliable PDF Fetching:** Created `tools/fetch_paper.py` to handle PDF downloads, 403 errors, and alternative URL searches programmatically, replacing fragile prompt-based logic.

2.  **Phase 2: Logic & Flow (Completed)**
    *   **Enforced Verification:** Modified `graph.py` to *mandate* a verification step after any research agent (`econpaper`, `caselaw`) runs. This guarantees that all citations are fact-checked.
    *   **Dynamic Debate:** Enhanced `debate.py` and `agents/arbiter.py` to support a dynamic, context-aware debate loop. The Arbiter now decides when to end the debate based on the quality of arguments, rather than a fixed round count.

3.  **Phase 3: Testing (Completed)**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Fixed existing tests in `tests/` to align with the new strict mode and validation logic.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Created `tests/test_workflow_integration.py` to verify the full Supervisor -> Research -> Verifier -> Synthesis pipeline.
    *   **Debate Tests:** Created `tests/test_debate_logic.py` to verify the dynamic debate loop and context preservation.
    *   **Result:** All 22 tests passed successfully.

4.  **Phase 4: Documentation & Polish (Completed)**
    *   **README Update:** Documented `STRICT_MODE`, the new verification workflow, and tool capabilities in `README.md`.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enhanced `tools/sequential_thinking.py` to log internal thought processes (Thought, Hypothesis, Conclusion) to the main log file for full auditability.
    *   **Config Fix:** Updated `config.py` to handle Windows-specific `npx` execution (`npx.cmd`).

5.  **Phase 5: MVP Refinement & Critical Fixes (Completed)**
    *   **Tool Access Fix:** Resolved a critical bug where the `EconPaper` agent was instructed to use `fetch_paper_content` but lacked access to it in `agents/__init__.py`.
    *   **Agent Alignment:** Updated `agents/verifier.py` to use the robust `fetch_paper_content` tool instead of brittle manual retry logic, and synced `AGENTS.md` with the actual codebase.
    *   **Tool Robustness:** Enhanced `tools/fetch_paper.py` with top-level error handling to prevent workflow crashes during network failures.
    *   **New Integration Tests:** Added `tests/test_agent_tools.py` to verify tool availability and execution logic for the `EconPaper` agent.
    *   **Synthesis Standardization:** Refined `agents/synthesis.py` to strictly enforce a professional "Executive Summary -> Detailed Analysis -> References" output format and de-duplicate citations.

6.  **Phase 6: Deepening the Moat (Cognitive Architecture Upgrade)**
    *   **Hyper-Technical Prompts:** Upgraded `Pro` and `Cons` agents to mandate specific economic models (GUPPI, SSNIP) and legal precedents, penalizing vague assertions.
    *   **Recursive Research:** Unshackled the `EconPaper` agent from "abstract-only" limits, demanding full extraction of methodology, data sources, and robustness checks.
    *   **Socratic Debate Loop:** Transformed the linear debate into a feedback loop. The `Arbiter` now injects specific critiques (via `SystemMessage`) into the conversation, forcing agents to address gaps in subsequent rounds.
    *   **Gap Analysis:** Instructed the `Synthesis` agent to explicitly identify missing data and uncertainties, rather than glossing over them.

7.  **Phase 7: Resilience (Working Paper Fallback)**
    *   **Heuristic Implementation:** Updated `tools/fetch_paper.py` to mimic human economist behavior. If a primary URL fails (paywall/403), the system now automatically searches for "Working Paper" versions (NBER, SSRN, Author Websites) using the title and authors.
    *   **Tool Signature:** Updated `fetch_paper_content` to accept an `authors` parameter to refine these fallback searches.

8.  **Phase 8: Relentless Execution (Quality Control)**
    *   **HTML Fallback:** Updated `tools/fetch_paper.py` to attempt HTML text extraction (via `tavily_extract`) if PDF conversion fails. This ensures content retrieval even for HTML-only journals (e.g., JEP).
    *   **Ruthless Verification:** Upgraded the `Verifier` agent to explicitly **REJECT** research that relies on abstracts or reports extraction failures, forcing a retry loop.
    *   **Long-Form Mandate:** Instructed the `Synthesis` agent to produce comprehensive, 5-10 page reports (min. 2000 words), expanding on every point with full derivations.
    *   **Demanding Supervision:** Reconfigured the `Supervisor` agent to act as a "Demanding Managing Partner" who refuses to accept "I couldn't find it" as an answer.
